# Directory generator

A simple yet stupid directory generator, written in bash script.

## Why I made this kind of script (read: rubbish)?
It needs a lot of effort to restructure the home or any disk directory every time reinstalling or migrating my files into a newer system/drive manually. So, rather than creating it right at the time, I would like to prepare the structure first and keeps everything less cluttered.

## How to use
1. Modify the directory list to suit your needs. You can create a newer text file and write it with any directory as your wish.
2. Edit the config_set_dir file. It is used to define which base directory you're going to generate those new directory.
3. Execute the full_generate.sh script.
